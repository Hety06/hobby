<h2>Photoshopping Images Together</h2>

<p>When I want to create a photoshop, I like to just brainstorm about what I should make. Sometimes I just want to combine two animals. Animal combinations are always the best ones to do because if you find animals with similar colors, it will look really good. After choosing the animals I want, I just search for animals with similar colors. If you're photoshop is lacking something, you can always add filters, my favorite is <i>Oil Paint</i>.</p>

<h2>The Process</h2>

<p>First I open one of the pictures on photoshop, usually the one I like the background on more. After that I open the other animal and use the cut tool to cut out what I want to add. Then I copy the image I want to cut out and paste it on the first opened picture. Once I've lined up the images I use the eraser tool to cut off any excess. Afterwards I like to use the blur and smudge tools to merge the images together. Maybe change the opacity of the images to make them merge easier.</p>

<h2> Further in Photoshop</h2>

<p>When I use photoshop it can be to make a random thing or to conduct business. Since it's a "hobby" in this case, I usually just make random things. You can use photoshop to delete things and create things. For example in the picture of the frog I deleted the frog's eye so that everything fit in the picture. In the picture of the giraffe I erased the giraffe's front legs, to make it weirder. Here are some pictures of awesome photoshop edits <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cool+photoshops&rlz=1C1CHWA_enUS615US616&espv=2&biw=1366&bih=643&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMIjO_19oCLyAIVh40NCh2SeQ4T&safe=active&ssui=on">Cool Photoshops.</a></p>

<h2>Learning How to Photoshop</h2>

<p>I started this 2 years ago when I learned how to photoshop in Mr. Brown's class. He gave us plenty of online tools to help us with photoshop. Here is a link with easy photoshop tutorials <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/tutorials.html">Getting Started With Photoshop.</a> Anything you ever do always has a beginning to it, for me the beginning was learning how to use the tools in order to edit pictures. I love creating pictures and making edits in photoshop, maybe you will too.</p>
